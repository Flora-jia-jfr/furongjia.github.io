## Getting Started with Your Blog

Here are some ideas for blog posts you might want to write:

1. **Research Updates**: Share progress on your current research projects
2. **Paper Summaries**: Explain complex papers in accessible language
3. **Technical Tutorials**: Share knowledge about tools and methods you use
4. **Conference Experiences**: Write about conferences you attend
5. **Career Advice**: Share insights about academic life and career development

## Formatting Tips

You can use various formatting options:

- **Bold text** for emphasis
- *Italic text* for subtle emphasis
- `Code snippets` for technical terms
- Links to [external resources](https://example.com)

### Code Blocks

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
    return "This is a code example"
```

### Mathematical Expressions

If you need to include mathematical expressions, you can use LaTeX syntax with MathJax:

- Inline math: $E = mc^2$
- Block math: $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}$$

## Images
